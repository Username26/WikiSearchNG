		"content": "ATP-binding cassette sub-family E member 1 (ABCE1) also known as RNase L inhibitor (RLI) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ABCE1 gene.
ABCE1 is an ATPase that is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters superfamily and OABP subfamily.ABCE1 inhibits the action of ribonuclease L. Ribonuclease L normally binds to 2-5A (5'-phosphorylated 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates) and inhibits the interferon-regulated 2-5A/RNase L pathway, which is used by viruses. ABCE1 heterodimerize with ribonuclease L and prevents its interaction with 2-5A, antagonizing the anti-viral properties of ribonuclease L, and allow the virus to synthesize viral proteins. It has also been implicated to have an effect in tumor cell proliferation and antiapoptosis.ABCE1 is an essential and highly conserved protein that is required for both eukaryotic translation initiation as well as ribosome biogenesis.  The most studied homologues are Rli1p in yeast and Pixie in Drosophila.",
