		"content": "Riot is a 2019 indie video game about a riot simulator based on real events. The project started with an Indiegogo campaign in February 2014, which ended in a success. The game was released on December 6, 2017 for Steam's early access. The director of the game and previously an editor and cinematographer at Valve, Leonard Menchiari, has experienced riots personally and the game \"Riot\" was created as a way to express it and to tell the stories of these events. The player can pick between playing as police or rioters. The game will potentially be released on Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. The producers are interested in bringing the game to these platforms, but are currently restricted by their budget.",
