		"content": "Ranch to Market Road 2244 (RM 2244) is an 11.3-mile (18.2 km) state-maintained roadway located in Travis County, Texas. It is simply called 2244 for short as well as Bee Cave Road or Bee Caves Road. Whether the name of the road is Bee Cave (singular) or Bee Caves (plural) is a matter of some confusion even among locals (road signs vary), but the prevailing view is that Bee Caves Road leads to the town of Bee Cave, Texas, and at least one local newspaper has settled on the plural name for the road.  (This confusion is not recent: The post office for the town of Bee Cave opened there under the name Bee Caves in 1870.)",
