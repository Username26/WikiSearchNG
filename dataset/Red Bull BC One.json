		"content": "Red Bull BC One is an annual international B-Boy competition organized by the energy drink company Red Bull. It is an individual B-Boy competition, notable for being the only one of the major international breaking championships to not include a crew event. The main event is a knockout tournament featuring sixteen B-Boys and B-Girls, chosen for exceptional skills in the dance and good character, competing in one-on-one battles decided by a panel of five judges. Regional Finals are held for North America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. The winners of each region go on and participate in the World Finals. The inaugural BC One was held in Biel, Switzerland in 2004.
An official Red Bull BC One DVD was released for the 2004 and 2005 events. The production of the DVDs has been criticized due to musical rights, as the live music played during the competition had to be dubbed over. From 2006 and on, Red Bull stopped releasing DVDs and made the videos available online for free.In 2007, Alastair Siddon directed a film about the Red Bull BC One 2007 competition. The film was released in March 2010 under the title, \"Turn it Loose.\"
Since 2014, Red Bull BC One partnered up with the World BBoy Series and helped create Undisputed, an event to crown the solo world bboy champion.
