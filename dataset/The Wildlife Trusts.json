People are part of nature; everything we value ultimately comes from it and everything we do has an impact on it
The natural world is valuable in its own right, and is the foundation of our wellbeing and prosperity; we depend on it and it depends on us
Everyone deserves to live in a healthy, wildlife-rich natural world
Everyone should have the opportunity to experience the joy of wildlife in their daily lives",
