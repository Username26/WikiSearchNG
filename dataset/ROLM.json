IBM's ROLM division was later half sold to Siemens AG in 1989, whereupon the manufacturing and development became wholly owned by Siemens and called ROLM Systems, while marketing and service became a joint venture of IBM with Siemens, called ROLM Company. After nearly 30 years, phone products with the name \"Rolm\" were discontinued in the late 1990s, as sales dropped in markets dominated by new technology with other products or other companies.
