The republic is part of the North Caucasian Federal District, and shares land borders with the country of Georgia to its south; and borders the Russian republics of Dagestan to its east and north, Ingushetia and North Ossetia–Alania to its west; while sharing a border with Stavropol Krai to its northwest.
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was split into two parts: the Republic of Ingushetia and the Chechen Republic. The latter proclaimed the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, which sought independence. Following the First Chechen War with Russia, Chechnya gained de facto independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Russian federal control was restored during the Second Chechen War. Since then there has been a systematic reconstruction and rebuilding process, though sporadic fighting continued to take place in the mountains and southern regions until 2017.The republic covers an area of 17,300 square kilometres (6,700 square miles), with a population of over 1.4 million residents. It is home to the indigenous Chechens, a people of Vainakh ancestry and primarily Muslim faith. Grozny is the capital and largest city.",
