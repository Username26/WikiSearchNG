		"content": "Lord Randolph Henry Spencer-Churchill (13 February 1849 â€“ 24 January 1895) was a British statesman. Churchill was a Tory radical and coined the term 'Tory democracy'. He inspired a generation of party managers, created the National Union of the Conservative Party, and broke new ground in modern budgetary presentations, attracting admiration and criticism from across the political spectrum. His most acerbic critics were in his own party, among his closest friends; but his disloyalty to Lord Salisbury was the beginning of the end of what should have been a glittering career.  His elder son, Winston, wrote a biography of him in 1906.
