		"content": "The German Air Ministry (Reichsluftfahrtministerium; RLM)  had a system for aircraft designation which was an attempt by the aviation authorities of the Third Reich to standardize and produce an identifier for each aircraft design's airframe type produced in Germany.  It was in use from 1933 to 1945 though many pre-1933 aircraft were included and the system had changes over those years.
As well as aircraft of the Luftwaffe, it covered civilian airliners and sport planes, due to the RLM handing all aviation-related matters in the Third Reich, both civilian and military in nature.",
