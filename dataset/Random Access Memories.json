		"content": "Random Access Memories is the fourth studio album by French electronic duo Daft Punk, released on 17 May 2013 by Daft Life and Columbia Records. The album pays tribute to late 1970s and early 1980s American music, particularly from Los Angeles. This theme is reflected in the album's packaging, as well as its promotional campaign, which included billboards, television advertisements, and a web series. Recording took place at Henson Recording Studios, Conway Recording Studios and Capitol Studios in California, Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and Gang Recording Studio in Paris, France.
Following the minimal production of their previous studio album, Human After All (2005), Daft Punk recruited session musicians to perform live instrumentation and limited the use of electronic instruments to drum machines, a custom-built modular synthesizer, and vintage vocoders. The album has been noted by music critics as a disco album, while drawing influence from progressive rock and pop. The album features collaborations with Giorgio Moroder, Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams, Nathan East, and Pharrell Williams. It is Daft Punk's first album released through Columbia Records.
Random Access Memories became Daft Punk's first album to top the US Billboard 200, selling over 339,000 copies in its first week of sales. It has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also topped the charts in twenty other countries. Its lead single \"Get Lucky\" was a critical and commercial success, topping the charts in over thirty countries and becoming one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. The album received critical acclaim, appearing on several year-end lists, and won in several categories at the 2014 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, Best Dance/Electronica Album, and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. \"Get Lucky\" also won the awards for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 295 on their list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".
