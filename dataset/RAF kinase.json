		"content": "RAF kinases are a family of three serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that are related to retroviral oncogenes. The mouse sarcoma virus 3611 contains a RAF kinase-related oncogene that enhances fibrosarcoma induction.  RAF is an acronym for  Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma.RAF kinases participate in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signal transduction cascade, also referred to as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Activation of RAF kinases requires interaction with RAS-GTPases.
The three RAF kinase family members are:

A-RAF
B-RAF
c-Raf",
