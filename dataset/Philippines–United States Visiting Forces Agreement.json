The first of these documents is commonly referred to as \"the VFA\" or \"VFA-1\",
and the second as \"VFA-2\" or \"the Counterpart Agreement\". A visiting forces agreement is a version of a status of forces agreement that only applies to troops temporarily in a country.  The agreements came into force on May 27, 1999, upon ratification by the Senate of the Philippines.[8], [10] The United States government regards these documents to be executive agreements not requiring approval by the United States Senate.[42]",
