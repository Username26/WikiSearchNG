		"content": "RTL 8 is a Dutch free-to-air television channel that was launched on 18 August 2007 replacing Tien, previously known as Talpa. RTL 8's main target is the female audience. It broadcasts soap operas, talk shows, films and reruns of programmes from its sister RTL channels. In the mornings and late afternoons children's channel RTL Telekids is broadcasting on RTL 8. Officially RTL 8, along with all other Dutch RTL channels, is broadcasting under a Luxembourg television license. Therefore, the channel is also headquartered in Luxembourg. By doing this RTL can avoid more severe control by the Dutch media authorities, as Luxembourg does not have a strict authority that regulates its broadcasters.",
