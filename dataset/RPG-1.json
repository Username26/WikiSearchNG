		"content": "The RPG-1 (Russian: РПГ-1, Ручной противотанковый гранатомёт, Ruchnoy Protivotankovy Granatomyot; English: hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher) was a Soviet lightweight anti-tank rocket equipped with a shaped charge warhead. The design was inspired by similar weapons being introduced by the US and Germany in the late-World War II period. Work on the design began in 1944 and continued until 1948, but it was not put into production, as the RPG-2 was selected for this role instead. The RPG-1 introduced the basic physical and mechanical layout that was also used on the RPG-2 and the much more famous and ubiquitous RPG-7.",
