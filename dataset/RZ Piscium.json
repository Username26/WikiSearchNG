		"content": "RZ Piscium (or RZ Psc) is a UX Orionis type variable star 550 light-years (170 pc) away, in the constellation Pisces. Over the years, the star has been found to brighten and dim erratically, dimming by as much as a tenth of its usual luminosity. RZ Piscium  has been found to emit large amounts of infrared radiation, suggesting the presence of a substantial mass of gas and dust orbiting the star, possibly from a \"disrupted planet\".",
