		"content": "Transcription factor RFX3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RFX3 gene.This gene is a member of the regulatory factor X gene family, which encodes transcription factors that contain a highly-conserved winged helix DNA binding domain. The protein encoded by this gene is structurally related to regulatory factors X1, X2, X4, and X5. It is a transcriptional activator that can bind DNA as a monomer or as a heterodimer with other RFX family members. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene, and at least one of the variants utilizes alternative polyadenylation signals.",
