		"content": "RPG III is a dialect of the RPG programming language that was first announced with the IBM System/38 in 1978. An upgraded version, RPG IV, was introduced in 1994. In 2001 RPG was again updated to remove a number of column restrictions. RPG continues to be upgraded on a regular basis. The last fixed form restrictions were removed in 2015. Other than sharing some opcodes and terminology, modern RPG IV is visually very different from RPG III.
