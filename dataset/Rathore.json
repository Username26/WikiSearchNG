		"content": "The Rathore is a clan of Hindu Rajputs found in Northern India. They form a part of the thirty-six Rajput Clans. Alternative spellings include Rathaur or Rathor or Rathur or Rathod or Rathour or Rahtore. The bravery of the Rathore horsemen was appreciated by Beno√Æt de Boigne after his campaign against them.The Rathores just like other Rajput clans variously claim descent from the Suryavansha (solar dynasty) However, historians state that such illustrious descent has no historical basis, and was fabricated by Brahmins in order to give mainly low caste illiterate warriors greater status and prestige in a process called Rajputization.The Rathores also claim to be descendants of the 11th century Gahadavala dynasty of Varanasi. The Rathores of Jodhpur State claimed to be descendants of Jayachandra. The rulers of the Manda feudal estate, who described themselves as Rathore, traced their ancestry to Jayachandra's alleged brother Manikyachandra (Manik Chand). These claims are sourced through bardic chronicles; for example, according to Prithviraj Raso, Rathore was an epithet of Jayachandra (Jaichand). These claims are of later origin, and their historical veracity is doubtful. In the medieval period, the Gahadavalas were anachronistically classified as one of the Rajput clans, despite the fact that the Rajput identity did not exist during their time.
