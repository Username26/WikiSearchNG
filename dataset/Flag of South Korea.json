'Taegeuk flag'), has three parts: a white rectangular background, a red and blue Taegeuk in its center, and four black trigrams one toward each corner. Flags similar to the current Taegeukgi were used as the national flag of Korea by the Joseon dynasty, the Korean Empire, and the Korean government-in-exile during Japanese rule. South Korea adopted the Taegukgi as its national flag when it gained independence from Japan on 15 August 1948.",
