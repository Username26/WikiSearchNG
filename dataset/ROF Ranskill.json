It was built to manufacture cordite and the site was located adjacent to what is now known as the East Coast Main Line railway at Ranskill, Nottinghamshire, just north of the town of Retford.
Cordite production ceased in 1945, but the site was retained by the ministry on \"care and maintenance\" basis for another 30 years. Few of the war-time buildings survive and site has been used as a waste disposal site for years.
