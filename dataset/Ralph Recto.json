Since 2010, he has been on his second stint in the Senate, first serving from 2001 to 2007. He was the representative of Batangas' 4th district from 1992 to 2001.
In 2007, Recto lost his reelection bid because, as many analysts believed, he had authored the unpopular EVAT (Expanded Value Added Tax) law. In July 2008 he was appointed to head the National Economic and Development Authority in the Arroyo administration, but resigned from his position in August 2009 in preparation for another run for the Senate in the 2010 elections.He is a grandson of statesman Claro M. Recto. His wife is actress-politician Vilma Santos.
