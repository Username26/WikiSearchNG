		"content": "60S ribosomal protein L37a is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RPL37A gene.Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis, consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 60S subunit. The protein belongs to the L37AE family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the cytoplasm. The protein contains a C4-type zinc finger-like domain. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.",
