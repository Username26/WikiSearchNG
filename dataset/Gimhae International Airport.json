The name \"Gimhae\" comes from the nearby city of Gimhae. It opened in 1976. A new international terminal opened on October 31, 2007. Gimhae International Airport is the main hub for Air Busan, Asiana Airlines and Korean Air. Runway 18L/36R is used for military purposes only for Gimhae Air Base, but due to increasing traffic, there are plans to open the runway for airliners. In 2018, 17,064,613 passengers used the airport.
As the airport is now beyond its design capacity, a new airport will be built on Gadeokdo to meet growing demand.",
