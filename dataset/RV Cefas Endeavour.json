		"content": "RV Cefas Endeavour is an ocean-going fisheries research vessel based at the port of Lowestoft and owned by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas).
She is used to support all aspects of Cefas activities from fish stock surveys to launching autonomous monitoring equipment. The ship was built to replace the former research vessel RV Cirolana, and was designed to minimise underwater noise, and therefore disturbance of fish â€“ ensuring better results from sonar equipment. Operation is currently outsourced by Cefas to AW Ship Management following a tendering process carried out in 2019.</ref>
The vessel was previously operated by P&O Maritime Services.Cefas Endeavour was constructed at Ferguson Shipbuilders in Glasgow. She was named by Lindsay Murray, Cefas' science area head for environmental management at Burnham-on-Crouch, who was also wife of the former chief executive Peter Greig-Smith. The naming ceremony took place on 20 June 2003, sponsored by Ben Bradshaw, then Under Secretary of State at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.",
