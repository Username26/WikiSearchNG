The Japanese name, Tsukūru, is a pun mixing the Japanese word tsukuru (作る), which means \"make\" or \"create\", with tsūru (ツール), the Japanese transcription of the English word \"tool\".The RPG Maker series was originally released primarily in Japan, before later versions also released in East Asia, North America, Europe, and Australia. It is a popular game development engine, with millions of games created using RPG Maker released on Steam every year, including hundreds of thousands of commercial games.
