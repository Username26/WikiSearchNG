		"content": "Rive is a platforming shoot-em-up game created by the Dutch video game company Two Tribes for PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux and Nintendo Switch, and is the first major release by the company after the company's downsizing and closure of their primary development team in late 2013. The game was unveiled on July 29, 2014, after a long time of quiet development of the game that originated as a 3D shooter for the Nintendo DS in 2005. The game uses the same engine as Toki Tori 2+ and was developed by a three-man core team.",
