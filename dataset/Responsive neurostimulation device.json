		"content": "Responsive neurostimulation device or RNS system is a neurostimulation system designed to prevent epileptic seizures.
The RNS device is implanted while connected to leads that are placed in up to two areas where seizures begin. The device monitors brain activity in order to detect abnormal patterns, and in response delivers electrical pulses in an attempt to prevent seizures. The RNS System was approved by the US FDA in 2013 to treat adults with partial onset seizures that are not controlled by medications. As of March 2017 over 1,000 patients have been implanted with the RNS System.
