		"content": "The Motorola Razr (styled RAZR, pronounced  like \"razor\"; codenamed Siliqua) was a series of mobile phones by Motorola, part of the 4LTR line. The V3 was the first phone released in the series and was introduced in July 2004 and released in the market in the third quarter of 2004. The V3 model was followed soon thereafter by the improved V3i, including a collaboration with Apple Inc. for iTunes to be built-in. It was launched in 2005.
Because of its unique appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone. However, within a year, its price was lowered and as a result, it sold over 50 million units by July 2006. Leading up to the release, Motorola's cell phone division sales were stagnant and losing money. The success of the Razr made the division profitable again. Over the Razr's four-year run, the V3 model sold more than 130 million units, becoming the best-selling clamshell phone in the world to date.The Razr series was marketed until July 2007, when the succeeding Motorola Razr2 series was released. The succeeding models were the V8, the V9, and the V9m.  However, Razr2 sales were not as good as the original V3 series, with consumers moving to competing products. Because Motorola relied so long upon the Razr and its derivatives and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for feature-rich touchscreen and 3G phones, the Razr appeal declined, leading Motorola to eventually drop behind Samsung and LG in market share for mobile phones. Motorola's strategy of grabbing market share by selling tens of millions of low-cost Razrs cut into margins and resulted in heavy losses in the cellular division.In October 2011, Motorola resurrected the Razr brand for a line of Android smartphones: the Droid Razr for Verizon Wireless (known simply as the \"Motorola RAZR\" on other networks) and an improved variant, the Droid Razr Maxx. The new \"Razr\" line shares the trademark thinness and stylized tapered corners with the original. The series was marketed until 2013.
On November 14, 2019, Motorola again revived the Razr brand, this time for an Android-based foldable smartphone styled after the original Razr, which carried the same name.",
