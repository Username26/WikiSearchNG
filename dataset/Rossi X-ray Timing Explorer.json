		"content": "The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) was a satellite that observed the time variation of astronomical X-ray sources, named after physicist Bruno Rossi.  The RXTE had three instrumentsâ€”an All Sky Monitor, the Proportional Counter Array, and the High-Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE).  The RXTE observed X-rays from black holes, neutron stars, X-ray pulsars and X-ray bursts. It was funded as part of the Explorer program, and is sometimes also called Explorer 69.
RXTE had a mass of 3200 kg and was launched from Cape Canaveral on 30 December 1995 on a Delta rocket.  Its International Designator is 1995-074A.",
