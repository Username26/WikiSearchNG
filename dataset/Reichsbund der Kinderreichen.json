To qualify as a member of this league a family should have at least four children. Widows were also admitted.
The German Large Family League was forcefully nazified after the Nazi takeover of power in 1933. As such its goal became the preservation and promotion of the German hereditarily healthy Aryan family (\"Erhaltung und FÃ¶rderung der deutschen, erbgesunden, arischen Familie\").",
