		"content": "The RN-5 (Autopista Comalapa, Boulevard Los Proceres) serves as one of the main highways in the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador. The highway connects the metropolitan area with the El Salvador International Airport, located in San Luis Talpa, La Paz, a municipality that borders with the San Salvador Department. The highway was built to replace the old Carretera al Aeropuerto, a small road that runs on the side of a mountain range, parallel to the Autopista Comalapa. This road has been turned into a scenic road. It overlooks the new RN-5 and the southern hills of the San Salvador Department. The total length of the highway is 40.7 kilometres (25.3 mi). It is currently the only highway that connects to the airport coming from the metropolitan area. Other highways connect with the RN-5 to provide connection to the other departments in the country. The construction of the first Carretera a Comalapa was made in 1980. The construction of the highway began in 2001 and it was completed and inaugurated on November 22, 2002. The part of the highway known as Boulevard de Los Proceres runs through the southern side of the city of San Salvador. The highway is also a vital area in the city. It connects with various restaurants, business centers, and other dealerships.",
