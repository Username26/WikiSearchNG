She was named Western Lady III on her entry to civilian service, as a passenger motor vessel for Western Lady Ferry Service.  From 2009 to 2015, she operated as The Fairmile for Greenway Ferry on their day cruise route from Torquay and Brixham to Dartmouth and Greenway. In May 2013, she was returned to her original wartime appearance. Torbay's \"ferry wars\" forced her removal from service, and in December 2015, RML 497 was acquired by the National Museum of the Royal Navy.",
