		"content": "RFDump is a software created by Lukas Grunwald and Christian Bottger for the purpose of security auditing of RFID tags. It is periodically updated to emerging RFID standards such as e-passport and Mifare encryption currently found on many pay as you go systems.
RFDump is a back-end GPL tool to directly inter-operate with any RFID reader to make the contents stored on RFID tags accessible. The tools reads an RFID tag's meta information: tag ID, tag type, manufacturer etc. The user data of a tag can be displayed and modified using either a hex or an ASCII editor. In addition, the integrated cookie feature demonstrates how simple it is for a company to abuse RFID technology, and how it can be used to spy on unwitting consumers. RFDump works with the ACG Multi-Tag Reader or similar card reader hardware.
