		"content": "Royal Air Force Buchan or more simply RAF Buchan is a former Royal Air Force station near Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It has been there since 1952, although the domestic site in Boddam is now closed. Until 2005 it was also home of one of the two Control and Reporting Centres for the United Kingdom in the form of twin double storey underground bunkers (R3A). As such it was responsible for coordinating all aspects of air defence as part of The United Kingdom Air Surveillance and Control System (UK ASACS).
The Type 92 radar, now operated remotely, is housed in a pressurised Radome. Until 1994 the base also operated a Type 80 radar and a Sperry TPS-34 amongst others.
The site is now called RRH Buchan.",
