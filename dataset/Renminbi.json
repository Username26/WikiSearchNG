		"content": "The renminbi (abbreviated RMB; simplified Chinese: 人民币; traditional Chinese: 人民幣; pinyin: rénmínbì; lit. 'people's currency'; symbol: 元/¥; code: CNY) is the official currency of China and one of the world's reserve currencies. 
The yuan (Chinese: 元; pinyin: yuán) is the basic unit of the renminbi, but the word is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally, especially in international contexts. One yuan divides into ten jiao (Chinese: 角; pinyin: jiǎo), and a jiao in turn divides into ten fen (Chinese: 分; pinyin: fēn). 
The renminbi is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China. It is sometimes referred to as the \"redback,\" a play on \"greenback\", the casual term for the US dollar.",
