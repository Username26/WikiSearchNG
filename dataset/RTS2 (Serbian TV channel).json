It focuses on culture, in addition to offering music and sporting events. Parliamentary sittings are also broadcast live on RTS2.
Though on average it doesn't draw high viewership, RTS2 often may win the viewing day with special sporting events or special parliamentary debates. RTS2 also broadcasts children's and educational programmes and reruns of old Serbian drama and comedy series.
Opened in 1971, it was, until the RTS1 transition to color in the mid 1970s, the only Serbian television station in color.",
