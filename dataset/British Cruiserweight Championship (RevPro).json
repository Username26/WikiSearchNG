		"content": "The British Cruiserweight Championship is a professional wrestling championship owned by the Revolution Pro Wrestling (RevPro/RPW) promotion. The title was created and debuted on December 6, 2008.The first champion was Mark Haskins, the-then holder of the Real Quality Wrestling (RQW) Cruiserweight Championship. Revolution Pro Wrestling (RevPro/RPW) recognized the RQW Cruiserweight Champions as British Cruiserweight Champions until Rockstar Spud vacated the title due to inactivity. Following the vacancy, both titles split their lineages. To crown a new champion, International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom (IPW:UK) hosted an 8-man tournament, won by Marty Scurll.
During his 2016 championship reign, Will Ospreay frequently travelled to Japan to work with New Japan Pro-Wrestling. This inactivity caused RPW to host a match to crown an interim champion, won by Josh Bodom. On April 13, 2017, Bodom defeated Ospreay to become undisputed champion.
