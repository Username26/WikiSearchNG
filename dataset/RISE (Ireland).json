		"content": "RISE is a democratic socialist political party in Ireland, founded in September 2019 by former members of the Socialist Party, including Paul Murphy TD. The name is a contrived acronym standing for Revolutionary, Internationalist, Socialist and Environmentalist. It is not a registered political party and has instead formed part of the Solidarity–People Before Profit alliance for electoral purposes since its foundation. RISE was formed from former members of Solidarity following a split in the party. It supports a Socialist Green New Deal to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030. It also supports nationalisation and democratic control of the banking system and the abolition of the “rights” of capitalist private property.The party runs a weekly podcast called Rupture Radio, and also launched a eco-socialist quarterly publication, Rupture, in July 2020.
