		"content": "Rugby Club Nîmes Gard (also known as just RC Nîmes) are a French rugby union club that currently compete in the Fédérale 2 competition, the third division of French rugby. They have in the past played in the higher divisions, and in 1991 were quarter-finalists of the top French championship. Nîmes were established in 1963 and play in red and green colours. The driving force behind the club has always been former Béziers captain Louis Gagnière, who as president took the club to the top division in the late eighties and early nineties. After a long battle with illness he has returned to the club and they are becoming strong contenders for the top level once again.",
