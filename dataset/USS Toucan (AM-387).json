		"content": "USS Toucan (AM-387) was an Auk-class minesweeper acquired by the United States Navy for the dangerous task of removing mines from minefields laid in the water to prevent ships from passing. She was the only U.S. Navy ship named for the toucan, a brightly colored and easily tamed bird of the American tropics, characterized by its large but thin beak.
Toucan was laid down on 16 February 1944 at Cleveland, Ohio, by the American Ship Building Company; launched on 15 September 1944; sponsored by Miss Rose B. Jackiewicz; and commissioned on 25 November 1944, Lt. Comdr. S. H. Squibb, USNR, in command.",
