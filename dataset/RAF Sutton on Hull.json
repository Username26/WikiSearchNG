		"content": "Royal Air Force Sutton on Hull or more simply RAF Sutton on Hull was a Royal Air Force station situated in the suburb of Sutton-on-Hull (part of  Kingston upon Hull) in the East Riding of Yorkshire that operated from 1938 to 1961. During the Second World War, its primary role was to operate as No. 17 Balloon Centre of 33 Group (under RAF Balloon Command) which was headquartered in Sheffield. The balloons deployed from here were used as part of the defensive tactics against Luftwaffe bombing raids on Hull, Hull Docks, Grimsby and the wider Humber area.
After the war, the base was home to the Royal Air Force Fire and Rescue School before it moved to Royal Air Force Catterick in 1959. The site of the station is now part of the Bransholme estate.",
