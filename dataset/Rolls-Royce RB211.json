		"content": "The Rolls-Royce RB211 is a British family of high-bypass turbofan engines made by Rolls-Royce plc. Mismanagement of the initial development and consequent cost issues led to the effective nationalisation of Rolls-Royce Limited, to save the workforce and the engine businesses important to the UK and many other aerospace and aircraft operating companies.
The engines are capable of generating 41,030 to 59,450 lbf (182.5 to 264.4 kN) of thrust.
Originally developed for the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, it entered service in 1972 and was the only engine to power this type of aircraft. The RB211 engine was the first production three-spool engine, and turned Rolls-Royce from a significant player in the aero-engine industry into a global leader. In the early 1970s, the engine was reckoned by the company to be capable of at least 50 years of continuous development.The RB211 was officially superseded in the 1990s by the Rolls-Royce Trent family of engines, the conceptual offspring of the RB211.",
