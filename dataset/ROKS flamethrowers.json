		"content": "The ROKS-2 and ROKS-3 were man-portable flamethrowers used by the USSR in the Second World War.
The ROKS-2 was designed not to draw attention so the fuel and gas tanks were concealed under a sheet-metal outer casting that resembled knapsack; the flame projector was designed to resemble a standard Mosin–Nagant rifle. The purpose of this was to prevent the operator from being specifically targeted by the enemy. The flame shots were ignited by firing specially modified 7.62×25mm Tokarev cartridges.The ROKS-2 was used, amongst other engagements, during the close-range fighting during the first days of the Battle of Kursk in 1943.The ROKS-3 was a simplified model that was designed to be easier to manufacture. It did away with the disguise for the backpack, though it retained the flame projector designed to resemble a rifle. Both models carried around 9 litres (2.4 US gal) of fuel. The fuel was propelled by nitrogen gas pressurized at 115 bars (11,500 kPa)
and, under ideal circumstances, had a maximum range of around 45 metres (49 yd)}.The Finnish designation for captured ROKS-2 units was liekinheitin M/41-r. Captured Soviet flamethrowers saw some use by Finnish forces during the Continuation War. They were operated by two-man teams of combat engineers. They were well regarded by the Finns, although flamethrowers of all kinds saw little use by Finnish forces.Some ROKS-3 units were supplied to North Korea.",
