It lies near the open cluster Stephenson 2, which is located around 6,000 parsecs (20,000 ly) away from Earth, and is assumed to be one of a group of stars at a similar distance.  It is among the largest known stars, if not the largest, and one of the most luminous red supergiants, with an estimated radius around 2,150 times that of the Sun (Râ˜‰), which corresponds to a volume nearly 10 billion times bigger than the Sun. If placed at the center of the Solar System, its photosphere would engulf the orbit of Saturn.",
