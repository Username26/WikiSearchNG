		"content": "The Reel Top 40 Radio Repository, sometimes called REELRADIO, is a virtual museum of radio broadcasts, primarily airchecks from the \"Top 40\" era of radio in North America.  The archives are available by streaming.  Established in 1996 as the first online airchecks archive, it was transferred to a dedicated not-for-profit organization, REELRADIO, Inc., in 2000.  The site was organized as a series of \"collections\"; most collections represent the archives of a single contributor.  As of April 2018, the repository featured more than 3,568 exhibits.
Two collections are tribute sites to famed Los Angeles disc jockeys Robert W. Morgan and The Real Don Steele, and the organization also hosts other sites about the Top 40 eras at  WPGC in Washington and WIXY 1260 in Cleveland.
As of 2008, the board of directors includes founder Richard \"Uncle Ricky\" Irwin, news reporter Michael Burgess (known as Mike Scott) of KGPE (TV), and Bob Shannon (former vice president of TM Century).",
