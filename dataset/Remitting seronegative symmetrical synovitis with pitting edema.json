		"content": "Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (or sometimes RS3PE) is a rare syndrome identified by symmetric polyarthritis, synovitis, acute pitting edema (swelling) of the back of the hands and/or feet, and a negative serum rheumatoid factor. If no underlying disorder can be identified (idiopathic RS3PE), this entity has an excellent prognosis and responds well to treatment.RS3PE typically involves the joints of the extremities, specifically the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, wrists, shoulders, elbows, knees and ankles.
It is more common in older adults, with the mean age between 70 and 80 years in most studies.
It occurs more often in men than in women with a 2:1 ratio.
It is unknown how common this condition is.
