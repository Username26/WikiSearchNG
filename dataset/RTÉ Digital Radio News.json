It began broadcasting on 30 May 2007,  and was launched as part of an expansion of RTÉ's digital radio network, which now contains five digital-only stations, as well as four FM stations. The channel broadcast the latest RTÉ Radio 1 news bulletin live, at the top of each hour, and then played this on loop until the next Radio 1 update. The station also played audio from RTÉ television's main news programmes, RTÉ News: Six One and RTÉ News: Nine O'Clock.
On 12 June 2008, RTÉ launched RTÉ News Now, which operates along the same principle as RTÉ Digital Radio News, in that it streams the most recent television news bulletin from RTÉ One and RTÉ Two, through the RTÉ.ie website  and the RTÉ News Now channel on Saorview",
