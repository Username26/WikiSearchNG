		"content": "The RPG-26 Aglen is a disposable anti-tank rocket launcher developed by the Soviet Union. It fires a single-stage rocket with jack-knife fins, which unfold after launch. The rocket carries a 72.5 millimeter diameter high explosive anti-tank single shaped charge warhead capable of penetrating 440 millimeters of armour, one meter of reinforced concrete or one and a half meters of brickwork. It has a maximum effective range of around 250 meters. The RPG-26 is a product improved version of the RPG-22. The similar sized rocket features a slightly heavier and more powerful HEAT warhead and more powerful rocket engine. The limited extension of the RPG-22 launch tube was found of little use. Therefore the RPG-26 has a rigid non-telescoping launch tube.The RPG-26 and its variants are actively used by Russian forces. It has been exported to several nations and is actively marketed for export. The more specialized variants are in Russian service and available for export as well.",
