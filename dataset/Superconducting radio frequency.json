		"content": "Superconducting radio frequency (SRF) science and technology involves the application of electrical superconductors to radio frequency devices.  The ultra-low electrical resistivity of a superconducting material allows an RF resonator to obtain an extremely high quality factor, Q.  For example, it is commonplace for a 1.3 GHz niobium SRF resonant cavity at 1.8 kelvins to obtain a quality factor of Q=5Ã—1010.  Such a very high Q resonator stores energy with very low loss and narrow bandwidth. These properties can be exploited for a variety of applications, including the construction of high-performance particle accelerator structures.
