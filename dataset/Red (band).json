The band's first lineup also consisted of drummer Andrew Hendrix and guitarist Jasen Rauch. Since 2014, the line-up has consisted of the core trio of the Armstrong brothers and Barnes with current drummer Dan Johnson.
After they recorded several demos displaying a style of alternative, hard, and Christian rock music, Red landed a development deal with their longtime producer Rob Graves which led to a record deal with Christian label Essential Records in 2004. Their debut albums End of Silence (2006) and Innocence & Instinct (2009) were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album, and spawned the popular singles \"Breathe Into Me\" and \"Death of Me\". Red's mainstream popularity grew and their third album, Until We Have Faces (2011), reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200, which was followed by Release the Panic (2013), which peaked at No. 7. After Of Beauty and Rage (2015), Red started work on their sixth album, Gone (2017), which released in October 2017. Their recent seventh studio album, Declaration, was released on April 3, 2020.
