		"content": "NatWest Markets is the investment banking arm of NatWest Group. It was created from the then RBS Group's corporate and institutional banking division in 2016, as part of a structural reform intended to comply with the requirements of the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013 and to give the NatWest brand greater prominence. The Act implements the Independent Commission on Banking recommendation that domestic retail banking should be \"ring-fenced\" from riskier trading activities by 2019. The ring-fenced group, NatWest Holdings, was created at the same time.
To give it legal form, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc was renamed NatWest Markets plc in 2018; at the same time Adam and Company plc (which held a separate PRA banking licence) was renamed The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, with Adam and Company continuing as an RBS private banking brand.",
