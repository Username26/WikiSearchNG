RADIX 50's 40-character repertoire (050 in octal) can encode six characters plus four additional bits into one 36-bit machine word (PDP-6, PDP-10/DECsystem-10, DECSYSTEM-20), three characters plus two additional bits into one 18-bit word (PDP-9, PDP-15), or three characters into one 16-bit word (PDP-11, VAX).The actual encoding differs between the 36-bit and 16-bit systems.",
