Sting, Gloria Estefan (without Miami Sound Machine), Londonbeat, Extreme, Bryan Adams, The Temptations, and Tom Cochrane earned their first Canadian chart-toppers in 1991. The two Canadians who peaked at number one this year were Bryan Adams and Tom Cochrane. Along with Mariah Carey and Rod Stewart, Adams reached the top spot with more than one single.
