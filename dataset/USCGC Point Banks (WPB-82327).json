		"content": "USCGC Point Banks (WPB-82327) was an 82-foot (25 m) Point-class cutter constructed at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1961 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat by the United States Coast Guard. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name cutters under 100 feet (30 m) in length it was designated as WPB-82327 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Banks in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than 65-foot (20 m).",
